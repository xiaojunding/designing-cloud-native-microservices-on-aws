## Hands-on Events Exploring - a simple Event Storming Example

If you are new to Event Storming, and don't know how to start the domain event exploring journey, you can try thinking about this:

> Think about all the Events that had occurred from the time you woke up this morning, all the way until now as you are reading this post.

List them down and put each one of these Events into the orange sticky notes.

Note that you should use **past-tense** wording to explain what had happened - which are all just facts.

**[Challenge for you]** Now, let's add a little twist to what you have. Imagine that you have to attend a meeting today and you are already running late. Can you pick the most essential stickers to complete the "morning journey" on the timeline?

Note the key events that remain on the board. These are the critical path towards "attending a meeting". Translating to software development, consider when a Product Owner pushes a long list of *wish list* into your Product Backlog, how would you go about prioritising them?

This is where this *User Story Mapping* or *Impact Mapping* approach would be valuable. Pick up the most essential ones to work on as first sprint, then continue to explore the story and refine it.

Next, let's take a look at a slightly more complex scenario.
